Core project from CSCI.251, Spring 2020.

This program serves as educational practice with cyrptography and concurrent programming. 

Using the RSA algorithm, a user can send a message to another (under a wide area network), however, it is encrypted. To decrypt it, you would need
a 'key', a very large prime number that was first used to encrypt the message in the first place. Standard RSA practices are further reinforced in the code.

Due to events, the server that hosts communication between clients has closed. Furthermore, development of this project has discontinued.
